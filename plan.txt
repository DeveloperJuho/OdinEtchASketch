- To create A x A grid I'm going to create as many rows as there are going to be divs in a row.
- Rows will be inside a container that has downwards flex
- Rows will have normal flex

Javascript:
- Row width will be added in javascript as it has to be the input times div width
- When hover has happened to a square, add a class of painted

CSS:
- Row width is always the same and the same as height
- Flex.shrink is set to 0, nothing should become smaller even if stuff won't fit in to window
- Hover and painted squares have a different background color

TODO:

- Hovering
- Reset button functionality
- Check the extra portion of the assignment

Hovering:

- When mouse hovers over a grid, turn it to painted
- Hover and painted grids will have different background color
