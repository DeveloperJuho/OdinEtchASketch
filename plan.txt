- To create A x A grid I'm going to create as many rows as there are going to be divs in a row.
- Rows will be inside a container that has downwards flex
- Rows will have normal flex

Javascript:
- Row width will be added in javascript as it has to be the input times div width

CSS:
- Row width is always the same and the same as height
- Flex.shrink is set to 0, nothing should become smaller even if stuff won't fit in to window
